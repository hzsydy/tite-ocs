            <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
            <p>
                This extension to {@code VASSAL.build.module.Map} was done initially first to
                allow players to change the part of the game map displayed from the active
                playing area to a chart, turn sequence or other data and flip back again without
                having to laborious scroll there and back; second to allow the scenario creator
                to limit the portion of the map that could be scrolled over.
            <P>
                Since the charts etc to be leapt to are not necessarily inside the playable
                portion of the game map, multiple portions need to be defined and since the
                charts etc are not always upright the rotation of game map through 90,180 or
                270 degrees needs to be possible. Given the utility of these "bookmarks" it
                would be helpful if the player could define his own which would be private
                to him.
            <P>
                For all the bookmarks the zoom and rotation at which to display the map would
                be defined as well as the point to centre the view on. The bookmark for the
                game map itself will be the last point jumped away from so it will always be
                possible to leap to a chart and leap back again.
            <P>
                Since it will be required to move pieces between these different map portions
                there is a need to display two parts simultaneously. The ways to do this are
                to place a portion in a separate window or to split the view in half and display
                different portions in each half. These choices are best left to the player,
                so the extension needs to support both.
            <P>
                This means the same map or even the same portion of the map could be visible in more
                than one place on the screen at once. Multiple displays of the map need to
                be accommodated.
            <P>
                Some what are now separate maps are really adjuncts to the main map. Instead
                of being accessible via a top level button their jump points should be
                accessible from any main window view and vice versa.
            <P>
                It would be very desirable if when the game was saved that the windows and
                views visible for each player were remembered and when a game loaded the
                windows and views restored for each player
            <p>

                Additional Design Criteria
            </h2>
            <p>
                To improve the clarity of the code and also to help porting to Android systems
                the front and back ends of the system will be rigorously separated so the controlling
                logic will be in the back end whilst the front end will implement this as mouse clicks
                or whatever as convenient. This will also allow several different flavours of interface
                to exist for the user to choose between.
